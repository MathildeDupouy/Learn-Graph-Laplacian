# Context

This code has been written in the context of Geometric Data Analysis during the Master MVA 2023 by Adrien Ramanana Rahary and Mathilde Dupouy.

It is an adaptation from a code available here : https://github.com/TheShadow29/Learn-Graph-Laplacian?fbclid=IwAR0117ZvUag6RAW8p6sJOujPdNarhIZRHyF12eZ8KG4HhS_zWP7yXs0DQAc
This code is an implementation of the paper  Learning Laplacian Matrix in Smooth Graph Signal Representations 
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.7842.pdf
The original code can be found on the authors website [web.media.mit.edu/~xdong/pub.html](https://web.media.mit.edu/~xdong/pub.html)

THis repositorie contains the original scripts : code/solver.py and code/data_loader.py. We proposed another script to generate graph with a heat diffusion process (synthetic_graphs) and different tests were conducted on three different notebooks. The notebook code/main.ipynb contains in particular the main experiments discussed in our report.
